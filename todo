D SparseVizLog -> GPU Kernel LOG
D SparseVizLog -> FullSparseTensor Log
D making TIMING_LOG to work as expected (should only have an effect on terminal logging not csv)


Future work --------------------------------------------
D/K dimensions in tensor file should not be necessary
D why some locks are initialized and destroyed in main.cpp?, clean them
D csf + hicoo
D performance module, perf for orderings and kernels + cupti for gpu kernels and future gpu parallel orderings
D IO written from scratch, parallel IO module, matrixmarketio dependency removal
D kernel overview for efficiency
D: add matrix kernels for cpu and gpu
K/D add cpu tensor kernels
K/D add gpu tensor kernels
K/D MPI Kernels
D/K: Parallel CPU/GPU ordering of the matrices
K/D add matrix lexi ordering
K/D add tensor lexi ordering
K/D add COO to CSF conversion to tensor for CSF-based kernels
D/K add cpu affinity support
D/K add gpu grid/block auto multi/dimension support
D/K add [CPU] in front of cpu kernel log
D: make ordering supported matrix a shared object among all matrices constructed during kernel runs (in fact deleting ordering supported matrices before kernel runs would even be better)
D/K: why constructing the ordered matrix breaks our m_Ptr storage approach starting with the index of 1 instead of 0.
D/K: why warning issued saying amd dictates matrix to be a pattern symmetric matrix, FullChip.mtx is already a pattern symmetric matrix
D/K: Min Degree is problematic (tested with FullChip.mtx)
K/D adding eType
D: Testing
D .ord extension for plaintext (external) ordering
K/S add GORDER
K add new RCM-jaccard sparsification
K use bipartite graphs for rectangular, unsymmetric matrices in addition (or inplace of A+A')
K add matrix Maxi-BFS
K add tensor Maxi-BFS
K add METIS orderings (similar to PATOH with inner)
K active modes is not vType - simple int
K python binding
K matlab binding
K Extract features, kernel specific shap (Explainability) analysis and visualization
K Graph Hypergraph partitioniong, clustering visualization (multilevel for scalability)
K Error distribution for tensor decomposition
K Embedding - PCA - 3d visualization threejs
K Add vertex names and other metadata for graph visualization
K Add tensor dimension names for tensor visualization
K Add mohp as another ordering algorithm
